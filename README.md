# banknote-authentication- Machine Learning Project usinf MATLAB
## Introduction
<p>The dataset used is from a machine learning repository  <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication" target="_blank"> “UCI Machine Learning Repository” </a> . This data was extracted from sample images of genuine and counterfeit banknotes. The digitization of these photos was made with an industrial camera. Thus, the images obtained are 400x400 pixels, with a resolution of 660 dpi and in grayscale. Furthermore, the wavelet transform was used to derive features from all of these images.</p>
